# Articlate
A language article practice app built on ReactNative Expo with Watermelondb.

### Running

1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. run `npx expo run:ios` or `npx expo run:android`

> Note: In order to run you need to build a dev-client. But since this example is now using expo SDK 50, it will automatically build one with the `npx expo run:<platform>` command. If you still encounter issues, then build a dev-client.
